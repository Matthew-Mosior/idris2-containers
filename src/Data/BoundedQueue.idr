export

||| Naively keeps the first `n` values of a list, and converts
||| into a `BoundedQueue` (keeps the order of the elements). O(1)

||| We can prepend an element to our `BoundedQueue`, making it the new
||| "oldest" element. O(1)
|||
||| This is against the typical use case for a FIFO data
||| structure, but it allows us to conveniently implement

||| Return the last element of the `BoundedQueue`, plus the unmodified
||| queue.
|||
||| Note: `peekOldest` might involve a rearrangement of the elements
|||       just like `dequeue`. In order to keep our amortized O(1)
|||       runtime behavior, the newly arranged queue should be used
|||       henceforth.
